Weathers
rain: 24
sun: 26
hail: 20
sand: 18 (+1 form)

Plan:
1 more ghost type with hail abilities
2 more non-ice, non-ghost types with hail abilities
3 more rock-types with sand abilities
	Suggestions: Bastiodon replacing Shield Wall, Rampardos replacing Mold Breaker, Stonjourner as 2nd ability, Chewtle replacing Strong Jaw
2 more non-rock non-ground-types with sand abilities
Maybe 1 more Electric-types with a rain ability
Maybe remove sun ability from 1 grass type
Maybe add some hail vs sand abilities

Terrains

Lines with synergy abilities:
Grassy: 6
Electric: 6
Psychic: 4
Fairy Terrain: 3

Plan:
Replace Grassy Surge on Celebi
Move Grassy Surge from Burmy line to another
Replace Fairy Surge on Whimsicott (or move Mistcraft to it from Klefki?)
	Either way, whichever one loses it shoul maybe gain a Fairy Terrain synergy ability its in place
